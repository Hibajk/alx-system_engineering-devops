# POSTMORTEM: DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUES CAUSING SLOW LOAD TIMES
`ISSUE SUMMARY`
<br>
**Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes, from 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM UTC-5 on February 10, 2023
<br>
**Impact**: The website's load times were severely impacted, with 80% of users experiencing slow load times (> 10 seconds) and 20% experiencing errors. The affected service was the main website, which handles user authentication and dashboard rendering.
<br>
**Root Cause**: A misconfigured database connection pool led to a bottleneck in database queries, causing slow load times and errors.
# TIMELINE
10:45 AM: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts, which showed a spike in response times and error rates.
<br>
10:50 AM: The on-call engineer investigated the issue and noticed high CPU usage on the database servers.
<br>
11:00 AM: The engineer assumed the root cause was a database query optimization issue and began investigating slow queries.
<br>
11:30 AM: The engineer escalated the incident to the database team, who began investigating database connection issues.
<br>
12:00 PM: The team discovered a misconfigured database connection pool, which was causing a bottleneck in database queries.
<br>
12:30 PM: The team implemented a temporary fix by increasing the connection pool size.
<br>
1:00 PM: The issue was resolved, and load times returned to normal.
# ROOT CAUSE AND RESOLUTION
The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured database connection pool, which limited the number of concurrent connections to the database. This led to a bottleneck in database queries, causing slow load times and errors. The temporary fix was to increase the connection pool size, which alleviated the bottleneck and resolved the issue.

# CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
Improve database connection pool configuration and monitoring.
Implement automated testing for database connection pool configuration.
Add monitoring for database connection pool usage and alerting for potential bottlenecks.
Review and optimize database queries to reduce load on the database.
Implement a more robust incident response process to reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).
# TODO LIST
Patch database connection pool configuration to increase the number of concurrent connections.
Implement automated testing for database connection pool configuration using a tool like Pytest.
Add monitoring for database connection pool usage using a tool like Prometheus.
Review and optimize database queries using a tool like EXPLAIN.
Develop a more robust incident response process, including clear escalation procedures and communication channels.
